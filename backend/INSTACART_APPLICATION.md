## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Weeks 1-2)

# Product Search & Pricing
products = instacart_api.search_products("organic chicken breast", store_id=store["id"])
price_info = instacart_api.get_product_price(product["id"], store["id"])
```

### Phase 2: Meal Plan Integration (Weeks 3-4)
```python
# Generate meal plan with real pricing

for recipe in meal_plan.recipes:
    for ingredient in recipe.ingredients:
        products = instacart_api.search_products(ingredient.name, store_id)
        best_match = find_best_product_match(products, ingredient)
        shopping_list.append(best_match)

total_cost = sum(item.price for item in shopping_list)
```

### Phase 3: Shopping Cart Integration (Weeks 5-6)
```python
# Create Instacart shopping cart
cart = instacart_api.create_cart(store_id)
